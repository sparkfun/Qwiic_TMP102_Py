# Example for the TMP102 I2C Temperature Sensor
# Alex Wende @ SparkFun Electronics
# April 29th 2016

# This sketch connects to the TMP102 temperature sensor and enables the
# one-shot temperature measurement mode using the one_shot() function.
# The function returns 0 until the temperature measurement is ready to
# read (takes around 25ms). After the measurment is read, the TMP102 is
# placed back into sleep mode before the loop is repeated. This can be 
# useful to save power or increase the continuous conversion rate from
# 8Hz up to a maximum of 40Hz.

# This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at
# the local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!

# Distributed as-is; no warranty is given.
